DOM and DOM manipulation
=======

* DOM is the document object model
* Structured representation of HTML
* Used to connect web pages to scripts
* For each object inside a webpage, i.e. for anything surrounded by attribute tags, there is an object in the DOM
* JS interacts with the DOM using special methods
  * They are methods because they are functions attached to the document object
